# The Weakness Protocol

I am weak, as such I cannot rely on willpower and self-discipline to overcome my limitation and achieve what I want to achieve in life.

Every time I make goals and implementation plans I assume that I will have the discipline to carry through. I have been living with the delusion that when I don't feel like doing the _thing_ I will somehow prevail and do it.

It's a lie.

This is OK. We are all weak, if we accept this fact we can try to become strong.

## 5:00am - Wake up time

If I have no energy I will not be able to do what I need to do.

The only solution is to wake up early so I can work on my goals first. This of course implies that I will be able to wake up early. To ensure a successful early wake up time a few things need to happen.

* Get sufficient sleep
* Consistent wake up time
* Prevent snoozing

### Sufficient sleep

Most people require 7.5 hours of sleep. I am in that group based on self-experimentation. I wish I could only sleep for 6 hours, but I get super cranky and emotional if I do that. To make things worse I also lose energy and willpower.

On the flip side sleeping for 9 hours is fun for the first few days and then I just wake up earlier.

_nts: if you keep having trouble waking up, go to sleep even earlier so that way you wake up because you simply can't sleep any more_

7.5 hours +
5 minutes to fall asleep (I fall asleep super fast) +
10 minute safety (I am slow to wrap things up before going to bed)

Going to sleep time should be 9:15pm, essentially I need to be asleep by 9:30pm to get 7.5 hours of sleep

### Consistent wake up time

Waking up at a consistent time helps with waking up in general. It's the experience of waking up 1 minute before the alarm rings. I have only had this experience if my wake up time was consistent.

I am not sure how long that takes, it feels like it's a week or two, but let's just go with being consistent.

Only problem is Saturday morning wake up time since D&D goes to 11:45pm. I think / hope that can be dealt with as an exception.

### Prevent snoozing

A consistent wake up time can help with this. I think they are co-dependent. By not snoozing you can also get a consistent wake up time.

The only way I have been able to prevent snoozing and getting up is to move the alarm further away from me so I have to get up to go get it.

## Productivity

### TODO List

After various attempts to use apps to track all my TODOs, it appears that the easiest one to use for me is Google Tasks. Primarily because it allows me to read/write into the list from anywhere and I can see it while using my calendar which is where I do my scheduling.

_nts: Google Tasks is OK, but the check off functionality doesn't do much and I still have to work with the way it forces me to use subtasks etc, perhaps a simple text document that can I can read/write would do. It will need to be accessible by phone or computer and fast_

The TODO list needs to be a singular list for ease of processing and quick access.

Prioritization of items by letters seems to be ineffective since what is considered a priority changes from day to day for work and life.

My simple system is to move TODOs higher or lower in the list.

Having sections to delineate items based on topics and projects seems to help minimize the noise by allowing isolation of irrelevant TODOs.

_nts: Current system lacks a good way to trigger TODOs when a specific date comes up_

### Scheduling

Having TODOs but no idea of when they will be done is problematic. Currently I am using Google Calendar with recurring tasks for habitual events and then I try to fit in my TODOs for the day.

Of course the theoretical schedule set and the actual implementation differs.

In an ideal world everything that is scheduled would be done, but since I am weak. The thing I can hope for is to establish a good direction.

It does appear to help to have something scheduled first thing in the morning. My brain is not finicky enough at the start of the day to make up excuses and disobey.

### Focus

Uni-tasking is one of the key elements of my work strategy. Admittedly I always listen to music with simple rhythms and no lyrics, but I do not consider that multi-tasking.

It seems that I derive the best productivity if I focus on a task for about 2 hour time spans for a total of 4 hours. I get a tremendous amount of work done in a rather small time frame.

Keys for uni-tasking
* Ensure that I have no meetings in the next two hours (ideally), but even no meetings for the next hour works
* Set Mattermost to DnD and "close it" so it's not on the taskbar
* Close out Outlook to avoid email spam
* Play a Spotify playlist so I don't have to mess with what I am listening to, it needs to be something I have listened to before so I am not getting distracted judging the quality of music I am listening to
* Set my personal phone to "accept calls only"
